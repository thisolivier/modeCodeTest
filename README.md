This project contains an isolated problem that we need to solve. It doesn't have any network communication, 
and it only shows the state of the data sources.

This code is written without following best practices; it doesn't have any tests, there are no SwiftUI
previews, and most developers who have to fix bugs around it tend to spend more time than it should take.

Your job is to refactor it to make the code clean and maintainable, whatever your understanding of
these terms is. You have all the freedom to restructure the entire code and delete as much you feel necessary.

You need to apply pragmatic judgment and use practices you would expect to have in the production code.

If you run out of time, please briefly describe what else you would do.
